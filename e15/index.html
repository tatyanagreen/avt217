      <li>On top on the green circle and blue square, create a purple rectangle that is on top of both shapes on the left side but is long enough to where it comes out of both shapes.</li>
      <li>Next create a red circle, but bigger than the green circle. Place this circle at the tip on the bottom right side of the purple rectangle. Also make this a bright red color.</li>
      <li>On the left side of that circle, create another square, similarly in size to the blue square, but make it a navy blue. Also make the right edge of the square touching the red circle.</li>
